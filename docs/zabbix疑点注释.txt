Confusion with  Update interval and Flexible intervals
Refresh this item every N seconds.
Update interval (in sec)
	Note: If set to '0', the item will not be polled. However, if a flexible interval also exists with a non-zero value, the item will be polled 		during the flexible interval duration.
Flexible intervals
	You can create exceptions to Update interval. For example:
	Interval: 10, Period: 1-5,09:00-18:00 - will set the refresh to every 10 seconds for working hours. Otherwise default update interval will be 		used.
	If multiple flexible intervals overlap, the smallest Interval value is used for the overlapping period.
	See the page about setting time periods for description of the Period format.
	Note: If set to '0', the item will not be polled during the flexible interval duration and will resume polling according to the Update 		interval once the flexible interval period is over.
	Note: Not available for Zabbix agent active items.
